$ npm install --save-dev nodemon

ejs installation showed a critical serverity vulnerability message:
$ npm audit fix --force

to make use of a .env file the dotenv module is needed:
$ npm install --save dotenv

and finaly for the auth I'm going to use jsonwebtoken
$ npm install --save jsonwebtoken

Now some base configuration is needed in the package.json file, by adding this line to the scripts node:
"devStart": "nodemon ./bin/www"

The app can be started in deve by entering
$nodemon start devStart
